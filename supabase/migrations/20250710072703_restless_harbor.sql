  # Fix bookings table RLS policies

  1. Security Updates
    - Update RLS policies to work with custom authentication using registration numbers
    - Allow users to access bookings based on user_id (registration number) instead of auth.uid()
    - Fix booking creation and retrieval issues

  2. Changes
    - Drop existing policies that use auth.uid()
    - Create new policies that work with registration number based authentication
    - Allow proper booking operations for authenticated users
